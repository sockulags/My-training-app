# My training app
This started as a project to practise React, fetch API-data and some frontend skills. 

### Current state
Fully functioning home page where you can sort by different excersises collected either by search or by muscle group. There is also an exercise page where you can view that exercise more closely and get intructional videos on how to perform that exercise from YouTube. Below the instructional videos you will get examples of exercises of the same muscle group and exercises using the same equipment.

### Next up
I have started to make my own API in asp.net core. Here's some bulletpoint for myself which are the next steps:

- Get all endpoints working properly and make sure all data gets created and read as they should be
- Make sure update and delete functions work
- Create a form in React to be able to create a workout program
- Save the created program to the API
- Make a good-looking version of the program to be either save as a PDF or to print
- Fetch all previously made programs and display them in a nice way
